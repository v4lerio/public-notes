The Honeypots brief available [here](https://github.com/v4lerio/public-notes/blob/main/04_honeypots_brief.pdf) was shared during a presentation given to a private group of individuals during March 2021. It is based on one week of data collection, across 3 different regions, using the tPot Honeypot.

The brief was supported by more details shared during the talk. If interested feel free to reach out to me at https://twitter.com/valeriocestrone

This was a personal exploratory evidence-based project, made for fun, not for academic research. A blog post may follow in the future.

Installation notes are available here at [01_tpot](https://github.com/v4lerio/public-notes/blob/main/01%20tpot.md)
